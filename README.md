# Introduction and context

### Welcome to the first individual project of the labs stage of the Henry Bootcamp! In this occasion, I am going to perform as an MLOps Engineer.  

### I was tasked with developing an API using the **FastAPI** framework to make the company's movie datasets available. I was asked to create a minimum viable product ***(MVP)*** that included 6 functions for the API endpoints and another function for a recommendation system using machine learning.
